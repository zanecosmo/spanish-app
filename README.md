# Spanish Flashcards 
An app which persists a collection of Spanish and English word-pairs, curated by an administrator (myself) which can be accessed and studied by users who have an account. As the user studies words (which they can do by their grammatical part of speech, or by custom categories), they will be quizzed more often on words that they struggle more with, and less often on words they are clearly more comfortable with. The quizzes will be in the form of a flashcard memory game.

There are numerous reasons for the development of this project:
- To gain more skill building out APIs and transferring data between the browser and server.
- To dive deep into React and build a more complex app than I have previously.
- To help me learn Spanish.

## How it Works
The project is still in development, but will be hosted using either AWS S3/EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk. It will be a public app, and users will be able to create an account and log into the app online.

## About
The project uses SQL, Node/Express, and React, or the "SERN" stack.
